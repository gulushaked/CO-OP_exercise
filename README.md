**DummyApiPlugin**

This project is a plugin designed to interact with the DummyJSON REST API.

It performs authentication, collects various types of data (evidences), and provides a way to view the collected data.

*Features*

Connectivity Test: Authenticates the user and tests the connectivity to the DummyJSON API.

Collect Evidences: Collects three types of evidences:
User's cart details
List of posts
List of posts including comments
View Collected Evidences: Provides a method to view the collected evidences.

*Dependencies*
I used Python 3.12 version
requests Pyhton package: Used for making HTTP requests to the DummyJSON API.

*Usage*


1) Run the main script: python main.py

2) Follow the prompts to enter your DummyJSON username and password.

3) The script will perform a connectivity test and then collect the evidences.

4) After collecting the evidences, you will be prompted to view the collected data.

Thank you for considering my work :)
